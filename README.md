# Self-made basic LISP-like language interpreter

This is repo with my school-years project of LISP language interpreter. It was originally written for windows and msvc, but recently ported on CMAKE with darwin/linux support

TODO:
- Remeber/figure out how the concept was originally written
- Write a detailed installation/run instructions
